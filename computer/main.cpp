/*
    Main code that goes onto the computer
    Execute this to run trials from the LCDK output
    This code would be running in background continuously, detecting changes in lcdk/output
    It reads the text file made from train.cpp and apply HMM's onto the MFCC's from the LCDK
    This file exports speech recognition and an appropriate response as output/test.txt

    NOTE: I need to implement class objects and place it onto the MakeFile as well
