Hello. My name is Tad. How can I help you?
Hi Tad. I am angry.
Why are you angry?
I am not earning any money right now due to the government shutdown.
Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.
I hate the government.
The government serves its citizens by providing law and order.
But I am not earning money.
Well, maybe you should consider another job? As quoted by Mark Twain, find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.
